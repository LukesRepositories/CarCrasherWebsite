        <h1>About Car Crasher</h1>
        
        <p>Car Crasher is a high-stakes police chase game where players must skilfully navigate a four-lane motorway while evading law enforcement. The game's core objective is to survive as long as possible by avoiding various obstacles and collecting power-ups along the way.</p>
        
        <p>Players start with three lives and must carefully weave through traffic, avoiding collisions with trash cans, road signs, civilian cars, and trucks. Each collision costs a life, but players can replenish their health by collecting heart power-ups scattered throughout the course.</p>
        
        <p>Taking inspiration from Subway Surfers' engaging endless runner gameplay mechanics, the game combines this with a classic top-down perspective reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto 2's visual style, creating a unique and nostalgic gaming experience.</p>
